Adjustable Loan Schedule

This worksheet is a fully adjustable loan schedule calculator, allowing for different lenders, terms, payment frequencies, rates, and additional payments throughout the life of the loan. Such a tool can be used for running the numbers on potential real estate and large asset acquisitions. 

It was built from scratch with the intention of referencing a list of potential lenders, which are found on the "Loan Options" sheet. Thus, it had to take the user entered data and the referenced loan information and use it to generate the schedule. A column for additional payments was added, which had to be factored in to change the duration of the loan. This also allowed for a spot to show the saved interest from the additional payments. 

The functions and techniques used include: Data Validation, Combo Box, Array Functions, nested functions, Named Ranges/References, cell/sheet references, formatting, IF, Offset, Transpose, PMT, SUM, EDate, *,+,/,<=
